/**
 * The re-auth supervisor: the piece whose whole job is that the owner never
 * completes a login by hand again.
 *
 * The failure it exists to prevent already happened. A GitHub token expired
 * quietly, nothing noticed, and the next thing that needed it handed a
 * device-code prompt back to a human. Three properties follow from that, and
 * each one is a design constraint here rather than a nicety:
 *
 * 1. *Every* credential is tracked, not just OAuth tokens. A cookie jar with a
 *    session expiry and a password that a provider forces rotated fail the same
 *    way from the owner's seat, so they are swept the same way.
 * 2. Refresh happens well before expiry, not on the first 401. By the time a
 *    request fails the credential is already broken and something is already
 *    blocked.
 * 3. When it genuinely cannot self-heal, it says so *structurally* — which
 *    record, which reason, which strategy would fix it, and whether a human has
 *    to be present — instead of surfacing a stack trace and a login URL.
 *
 * The OAuth refresh itself is not reimplemented. `OAuthTokenRefresher` in
 * `oauth.ts` already does single-flight refresh, jittered backoff, and
 * `invalid_grant` to `needs_interactive_login`; the supervisor drives it through
 * `VaultCredentialStore` and adds the parts it does not have: everything that is
 * not an OAuth token, and the question of what to do once refresh is dead.
 *
 * The clock is injected everywhere. A supervisor whose correctness depends on
 * expiry arithmetic cannot be tested with real sleeps.
 *
 * Ported from Andromeda `src/vault/supervisor.ts`. The one behavioural change:
 * `findProviderDescriptor` comes from the injected adapter
 * (`provider-descriptor.ts`) rather than Andromeda's hardcoded built-in table,
 * so the default resolver returns an OAuth configuration only when the adapter
 * has one registered.
