/**
 * The vault-facing slice of a provider route registry.
 *
 * In Andromeda, the supervisor resolves OAuth refresh configurations from a
 * hardcoded built-in descriptor table. This plugin already has a provider
 * registry — `dsh-providers` `PROVIDER_ROUTES` — so the table is not ported;
 * instead this module is an *injected* adapter over whatever route registry the
 * composition root registers, which is how `dsh-providers` is wired in without
 * dsh-credentials depending on it (their peer dependency runs the other way).
 *
 * Two sources, both injected:
 *
 * - `registerProviderRoutes` records which provider ids exist and whether each
 *   authenticates with an api key or OAuth. Any array shaped like
 *   `dsh-providers`' `ProviderRoute` (id, displayName, authKind) satisfies the
 *   structural type, so this module never imports the plugin.
 * - `registerOAuthSupplement` supplies the refresh-capable OAuth endpoints for
 *   the OAuth routes. `PROVIDER_ROUTES` carries the wire facts (dialect, base
 *   url, credential refs) but not OAuth authorization-server endpoints, so
 *   those arrive here, validated by the same https-or-loopback rule the
 *   descriptor schema enforced.
 *
 * `auth` is null exactly when the vault has no refresh protocol to speak for a
 * provider: an api-key route has nothing to refresh, and an OAuth route without
 * a supplement entry is a session whose renewal the vault cannot drive — the
 * supervisor answers "expired_without_refresh_path" for both, which is the
 * honest outcome for imported subscription tokens.
 *
 * Not part of the Andromeda port; new for this plugin (the injected-adapter
 * form of `built-in.ts`'s `findProviderDescriptor`).
 * @module dsh-credentials/vault/provider-descriptor
