/**
 * Everything else in the macOS keychain that names itself as a credential.
 * Reported without being read: an item another application owns makes the OS ask
 * the owner before releasing it, and a scan is exactly the wrong moment to raise
 * a modal dialog. So this detector says "there is a credential here" and leaves
 * importing it to a deliberate, attended `vault add`.
 *
 * This detector had the right instinct before the rest of the module did. What
 * was special-cased here — report it, do not demand it — is now what every
 * keychain detector does by default, via `readKeychainItem`.
