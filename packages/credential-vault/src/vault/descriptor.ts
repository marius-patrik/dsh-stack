/**
 * OAuth configuration types for the vault's refresh protocols.
 *
 * Andromeda's `src/server/gateway/providers/descriptor.ts` defines the full
 * provider descriptor schema — auth, catalog, dialect, capabilities — validated
 * with zod. Only the OAuth configuration slice is ported here, because that is
 * all the vault consumes: the supervisor reads `auth.method` to decide whether a
 * record has a refresh protocol, and `oauth.ts` drives the two OAuth flows.
 *
 * Two deliberate reductions, both documented rather than silent:
 *
 * - The descriptor schema itself is not ported. Descriptors in Andromeda are
 *   parsed from source/config; in this plugin the OAuth configurations arrive
 *   programmatically through the provider-descriptor adapter, already typed, so
 *   re-validating them with a full schema would duplicate the type system. The
 *   one security-relevant rule that does survive is kept: OAuth endpoints must
 *   be https, or http on a loopback host (RFC 8252 §8.3's native-app
 *   exception), and the adapter validates every registered endpoint with
 *   `parseOAuthEndpointUrl`.
 * - The `auth.method` strings are the ones the supervisor and `oauth.ts` switch
 *   on, so `OAuthAuthConfig` is the two-member union rather than the full
 *   six-member auth enum (`none`, `api_key`, `external_command`, `aws_sigv4`
 *   are all "no OAuth refresh protocol" from the vault's seat, and are
 *   represented by `null` in the adapter).
 *
 * Endpoint semantics are ported verbatim: a plaintext token endpoint is a token
 * endpoint any on-path attacker can answer, and answering it with a 307 is how
 * a refresh token gets replayed somewhere else. The redirect wrapper refuses to
 * *follow* such a redirect; this refuses to be in a position to receive one.
