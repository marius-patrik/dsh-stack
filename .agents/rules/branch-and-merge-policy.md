# Branch and merge policy

- `main` is the only release branch.
- Every feature branch merges through a pull request into `main`.
- Pull requests must have green Canonical Stack workspace, Format repository, and Merge enforcement checks.
- Pull requests must contain the current `main` tip before merge.
- Merged same-repository branches are automatically cleaned up.
- Before a pull request merges, everything it touched must be scoped in attached issue(s): deferred work, follow-ups, or scope discovered mid-PR that isn't fully resolved in the PR gets its own linked GitHub issue, not an implicit or undocumented gap.
- A pull request's description must precisely describe everything the PR actually did — an accurate, complete account of the changes, not a vague or partial summary.
