# No duplicate or legacy implementations

There is exactly one implementation owner for every feature. Before adding code, locate the existing owner and extend/refactor it. Do not retain old APIs, icon registries, fallback implementations, compatibility bridges, or migration shims merely to preserve an old architecture. Claude and Codex skin-owned UI remain explicit skin ownership exceptions where specified by the product architecture.
