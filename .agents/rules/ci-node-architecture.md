# CI node architecture

CI automation is intended to run on a real DSH node managed through `dsh-hosts`, not on a bare GitHub runner installation. The node must boot the complete Stack, synchronize repository/node state through `dsh-hosts`, select the `headless` profile, and expose the GitHub Actions runner as one node capability. Credentials remain outside the repository.
