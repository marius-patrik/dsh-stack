// jscpd:ignore-start -- shared release-tooling boilerplate (module header), intentionally mirrored across scripts/*.mjs
/**
 * Fails when a `@dsh-stack/*` package that owns mutable client-side state
 * shared across more than one UI surface does not declare `dsh.client`.
 *
 * `src/scripts/client-runtime/client-bundle.ts` inlines every `@dsh-stack/*`
 * dependency into each consuming client bundle unless the package declares
 * `dsh.client` (see `.agents/notes/decisions/client-state-sharing.md`). A
 * stateful package left undeclared silently forks into one independent
 * instance per bundle it is inlined into -- exactly what happened to
 * `sidebar-preferences` and `skin-runtime` before #108, and what stopped
 * `skin-runtime`'s private-mode/blocked-storage fallback from working
 * consistently across surfaces.
 *
 * STATEFUL_CLIENT_PACKAGES is a reviewed allow-list, not an inferred set:
 * classifying "holds mutable state shared across bundles" requires reading
 * the package, so a human decision adds an entry here in the same PR that
 * introduces the state. A stateless package (pure components, constants --
 * `settings-panel`, the skin brand-mark packages) never belongs on this list;
 * duplicating it across bundles costs bundle size, not correctness.
 *
