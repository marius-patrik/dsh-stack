/**
 * Fails when a canonical package is unreachable: neither mounted into the
 * bundle, nor imported by another package, nor exposed as a CLI.
 *
 * The existing gates cannot catch this class. `knip` treats every package's
 * `src/index.ts` as an *entry point*, and an entry is by definition a root of
 * reachability -- so knip never asks whether anything imports it, and every
 * canonical package self-certifies as live. `jscpd` compares text, so two
 * independent implementations of one feature (a typed reducer in one package,
 * inline React in another) register zero clones. `verify-stack.mjs` compares
 * whole-file hashes, which only finds byte-identical copies.
 *
 * The result was an entire tab implementation sitting in the tree looking
 * canonical while the running UI used a different one, and a fix landing in the
 * dead copy. This gate asks the one question none of the others do: can the
 * running system actually reach this code?
