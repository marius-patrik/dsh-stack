/**
 * Derives a project-board Status from durable repository state.
 *
 * Board Status is a projection, never a source of truth. Every input this
 * reads — lifecycle state, assignees, labels, dependencies, the pull request
 * an issue is linked from — lives in the repository, so the same Status is
 * reproducible from scratch on any run without consulting the board's own
 * history. That is what makes reconciliation safe to run repeatedly: it can
 * only ever restate what the repository already says.
 *
 * The corollary is that Status set only on the board, with nothing in the
 * repository backing it, cannot survive a sweep. `Blocked` is the case that
 * matters in practice: it means an open `blocked_by` dependency or an explicit
 * `blocked` label, not an unrecorded judgement.

 * @param {boolean} [item.blocked] - Whether an open `blocked_by` dependency or
 *   `blocked` label applies.
 * @param {boolean} [item.assigned] - Whether anyone is assigned.
 * @param {boolean} [item.triaged] - Whether both an `area:*` and a `severity:*`
