/**
 * Fails when a canonical plugin/extension package is excluded from the
 * generated bundle as non-cordis without an explicit, justified allow-list
 * entry.
 *
 * The bundle generator (`generate-stack-bundle-patch.mjs`) silently drops
 * pack dependencies that have no cordis loader shape, and `pnpm build` prints
 * the exclusion only as a log line nobody gates on. That is exactly how
 * `@dsh-stack/workspace-tabs` (typed tab reducer, tests, its own package) sat
 * in the tree for releases while the live UI ran a different implementation
 * inside `src/packages/providers/client.js`: the pack manifest depended on it,
 * typecheck and build stayed green, and nothing failed because the exclusion
 * was invisible to every verifier. This gate turns that log line into a
 * decision: a package may be excluded from the running bundle only if a
 * reviewed allow-list entry here states why.
 *
 * The gate delegates the mount/skip computation to the generator itself
 * (`list` mode) rather than re-deriving the loader-shape probe, so the two
 * cannot drift apart. It requires every package's `lib/` to already be built
 * (`pnpm build` upstream), the same precondition the generator's `write` and
 * `check` modes document -- an unbuilt tree produces false exclusions, which
 * fail loud here rather than pass silently.
 *

/**
 * Packages the bundle generator may exclude as non-cordis, each with the
 * justification for its exclusion. An entry here is a deliberate, reviewed
 * decision -- not a way to silence the gate. Anything added without a real
 * reason recreates the `@dsh-stack/workspace-tabs` failure this gate exists
 * to prevent. An entry must be removed as soon as its package is deleted or
 * fixed; a stale entry fails this check.
 *
 * Two reviewed exclusion reasons exist today:
 *
 * - known cordis mount incompatibility: the package has a host entry but
 *   mounting it aborts or dead-ends the boot, as documented in
 *   KNOWN_CORDIS_MOUNT_INCOMPATIBILITIES (generate-stack-bundle-patch.mjs).
 * - client-only extension: the package reaches the running system as an
 *   extension composed into packs (so `verify-package-reachability.mjs`
 *   passes it) but carries no cordis host entry exporting `apply`, so there
 *   is nothing to mount as a bundle row.
 *
 * The remaining entries are pre-existing dead packages tracked for resolution
 * by #123; each must either gain a real owner or be deleted.
