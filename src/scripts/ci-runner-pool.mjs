/**
 * Autoscaling pool of ephemeral GitHub Actions runners: one freshly registered
 * runner per job, scaled to the depth of the queue.
 *
 * A fixed pool is the wrong shape for this repository. Every job runs the same
 * ~13-minute install/build/typecheck/verify/test pipeline, so a queue of open
 * pull requests serialises against whatever runner count happens to be
 * installed, and each merge invalidates the rest and re-queues them all.
 *
 * Each slot here loops: ask GitHub for a just-in-time runner configuration, run
 * the agent with it, exit after exactly one job, repeat. JIT registrations are
 * ephemeral and single-use, so every job is served by a runner that has never
 * seen another job -- no state leaks between builds, and a crashed runner
 * leaves no zombie registration behind.
 *
 * Slots are added while jobs are waiting and retired once the queue drains, so
 * the machine is not carrying idle agents between bursts.
 *
