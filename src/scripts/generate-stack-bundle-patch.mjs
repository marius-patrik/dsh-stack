/**
 * Generates `publish/packs/bundle/cordis.patch.yml` from the Stack's own
 * pack composition, so the harness-bootable dsh.bundle for the complete
 * Stack is derived from the real, buildable pack dependency graph rather
 * than hand-maintained.
 *
 * "The complete Stack" (this generator's design choice) is the union of
 * every concrete plugin/extension package reachable from the seven domain
 * packs under `publish/packs/` (`ai`, `core`, `ux`, `integrations`,
 * `agents`, `trading`, `vcs`) -- i.e. every pack a Stack profile currently
 * composes -- FILTERED to the packages that actually have the cordis
 * loader shape (a built `lib/index.js` exporting a function, or an object
 * with a function `apply`; per `src/scripts/plugin-check-kit.mjs`'s
 * `assertLoaderShape`). Not every package in that union is a cordis row:
 * `stack.kind === "library"` plumbing (e.g. `@dsh-stack/plugin-kit`) and
 * packages with no host entry export no `apply` and are excluded here
 * rather than mounted. Browser-only UI packages are NOT excluded on those
 * grounds: the client-modules scanner (`harness` `dsh-client-modules`)
 * discovers `dsh.client` bundles only from mounted loader entries, so every
 * package declaring `dsh.client` carries a no-op host `apply` (the same
 * convention as the harness's own `dsh-client-ui-*` packages) and appears
 * here as a row.
 *
 * Run with `check` to verify the checked-in file is up to date instead of
 * rewriting it (used by the bundle pack's `verify` script). Both modes
 * require every candidate package's `lib/` to already be built (`pnpm
 * build` upstream of this script), so the loader-shape probe reflects
 * real built output, not source guesswork.

 * tracked in the issue this bundle pack's introducing PR links.
 *
 * - `@dsh-stack/agent-skills` registers the `SkillRegistry` cordis service
 *   under the same key `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill` (mounted by every profile's
 *   `dsh-base` layer, see `harness/packages/bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml`)
 *   already provides, so mounting both aborts the boot with `service
 *   "skills" has been registered`. Does `@dsh-stack/agent-skills` replace
 *   the base row, extend it, or need a distinct service key?
 * - `@dsh-stack/agent-commands` and `@dsh-stack/agent-personas` both
 *   `inject: ["slots", ...]` a host-side cordis service named `slots` that
 *   no package anywhere in the harness or the Stack registers on the host
 *   (`slots` is a *client*-side browser concept, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots`,
 *   not a cordis host service) -- boot never activates them: `dsh: entries
 *   did not activate ... waiting for service: slots`. This looks like a
 *   defect in the two packages' own host-side `inject` declarations rather

 * `@dsh-stack/directory-picker-fix`'s `cordis.patch.yml`) is NOT read here:
 * only a profile's *top-level* `dsh.profile.bundles` layers have their own
 * patch applied at boot, and this bundle (`@dsh-stack/pack-bundle`) is the
 * one Stack profiles actually list there -- everything it composes arrives
 * as a bare `insert` row, so a disable that must land in the tree this
 * bundle produces has to be authored here.
 *
 * - `directory-picker` (harness's own `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-directory-picker-auto`,
 *   inserted below as a row of its own via the union scan) mounts its
 *   resolved backend as a *dynamic* Loader entry from inside its own
 *   `apply()`; under this bundle's full concurrent boot, that dynamic mount
 *   can race a second resolution of the same entry, double-registering the
 *   `directoryPicker` cordis service and aborting the boot with `service
 *   "directoryPicker" has been registered at <...>` (dsh-stack#188 -- did not
 *   reproduce in harness's own isolated `directory-picker-auto` test suite,
 *   nor in a bare `dsh web` boot with no Stack packages composed at all; only
 *   reproduced with this bundle's full ~250-entry composition present).
 *   `@dsh-stack/directory-picker-fix` (also inserted below) replaces it with
 *   a statically-composed equivalent that reuses harness's own exported
 *   resolver, so the native/browse choice stays exactly as adaptive as
 *   before -- this disable does not hardcode one backend, it only routes
 *   around the dynamic Loader-entry path that races.
