/**
 * Fails when a duplication exemption carries no stated reason, or is left open.
 *
 * The duplicate gate runs jscpd at `--threshold 0`, so an exemption is the only
 * way past it. That makes `jscpd:ignore-start` the one marker in the tree that
 * can silence a verifier, and `.agents/rules/verification-standard.md` is
 * explicit that a verifier must never be weakened to make CI green.
 *
 * The distinction this enforces is between the two things the marker is used
 * for. Wrapping genuinely structural repetition -- per-package scaffolding,
 * per-provider wire shaping that only looks alike -- is legitimate. Wrapping
 * real copy-paste to avoid extracting it is weakening the gate. Neither is
 * distinguishable from the other without a reason written down, which is why
 * the reason is mandatory rather than encouraged.
 *
