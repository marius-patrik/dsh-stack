/**
 * Generates `publish/packs/bundle-headless/cordis.patch.yml`: the same
 * union computation `generate-stack-bundle-patch.mjs` uses for the full
 * Stack bundle, filtered to the packages that are safe to compose under
 * `dsh --profile headless` -- a one-shot CLI dispatch with no web server or
 * dynamic Loader tree, unlike the `web` profile every other Stack package
 * assumes.
 *
 * "Headless-safe" (this generator's design choice) means the candidate's
 * declared `inject` list names neither `webServer` nor `loader`: headless
 * boots never compose harness's `dsh-host-webserver` (there is no HTTP
 * server to bind) or its dynamic Loader-entry machinery those two services
 * gate, so a package requiring either would sit forever at `pending
 * (waiting for service: ...)` rather than actually mount (dsh-stack#213,
 * following the same real, live-boot-diagnosed gap #187/#212 first
 * surfaced: headless composes zero @dsh-stack/* packages by default).
 * Filtering on the built `inject` array (not a hand-maintained exclusion
 * list) means a newly added package is included or excluded correctly
 * without this generator needing to know about it by name.
 *
 * Run with `check` to verify the checked-in file is up to date instead of
 * rewriting it (used by the bundle-headless pack's `verify` script). Both
 * modes require every candidate package's `lib/` to already be built (`pnpm
 * build` upstream of this script), so the loader-shape probe reflects real
 * built output, not source guesswork.
