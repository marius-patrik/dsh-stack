/**
 * The `dsh accounts` command: the owner surface over the same vault
 * `ctx.accounts` serves.
 *
 * The vault service keys records with the v1 bootstrap — the macOS Keychain
 * `dsh.accounts` entry with the `<home>/accounts.key` file as fallback — while
 * the ported CLI resolves its master key from `master.key` (base64) in the
 * vault directory. This wrapper is the bridge: it derives the CLI key file
 * from the service key (exclusively, so a deliberately separate vault is never
 * clobbered), points `ANDROMEDA_VAULT_DIR` at the service vault, and then runs
 * the CLI untouched. Run `dsh accounts init` once to write the vault config
 * the read commands require.
