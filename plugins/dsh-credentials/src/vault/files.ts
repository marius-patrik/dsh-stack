/**
 * Owner-only file publication for the vault, and for anything else in the
 * engine that puts a secret on disk.
 *
 * `src/cli/state-v2.ts` already has a hardened `writeTextAtomic`, and
 * `credentials.ts` has its own private copy of the same idea. This is a third,
 * and the reason is layering rather than oversight: `src/engine` takes its
 * authority by injection and does not import from `src/cli`, and the helpers in
 * `credentials.ts` are module-private in a file this slice must not modify. The
 * behaviour is deliberately identical to `credentials.ts` — same temp-file
 * naming, same Windows rename retry, same 0600 over 0700 — so the two cannot
 * drift into different durability guarantees.
 *
 * Two guarantees, and the second is the one that is easy to lose:
 *
 * - **Atomicity.** A reader either sees the previous complete file or the next
 *   complete file. A crash mid-write leaves a stray `.tmp` and an intact vault,
 *   never a truncated record.
 * - **The mode is never wider than intended, at any instant.** Not "is narrowed
 *   afterwards" — never wider, ever. `writeFile(to, bytes)` followed by
 *   `chmod(to, 0o600)` produces a correct *final* mode and a file that was
 *   world-readable for the whole of the write, which is long enough for a
 *   `kqueue`/`inotify` watcher to `open()` it; the fd it gets that way survives
 *   the `chmod`, because a mode change does not revoke an open descriptor. So
 *   the mode is set by the `open()` that creates the file, on a temp name that
 *   is not the published one, and the file reaches its real name already
 *   correct. `publishFileAtMode` is the only place in the engine that writes a
 *   file whose contents are a secret; `clis/import.ts` copies credentials
 *   through it for exactly this reason.
 * @module dsh-credentials/vault/files

 *
 * The `chmod` happens on the temp name, before publication, rather than on the

 * carries only the read-only attribute, and dropping it would stop a read-only
 * source file from being copied as read-only, which `verifyImport` compares.
