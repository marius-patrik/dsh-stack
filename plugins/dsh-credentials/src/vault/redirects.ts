/**
 * The `fetch` every credentialed egress in the engine goes through.
 *
 * ## The hazard
 *
 * `fetch` defaults to `redirect: "follow"`, and a redirect is the shortest path
 * from "this request carries a secret" to "that secret is at an origin nobody
 * chose". Measured on Node and on Bun 1.3.14 against two loopback servers:
 *
 * - `Authorization` **is** stripped on a cross-origin hop. That is the one case
 *   the fetch specification handles, and it is the case people remember.
 * - `x-api-key` and `x-goog-api-key` are **not** stripped. The strip list is a
 *   fixed set of well-known names, and a provider's auth header is whatever its
 *   descriptor says it is, so the runtime cannot know it is a credential.
 * - A **307 or 308 replays the request body verbatim**, method included. No
 *   implementation strips a body, because there is no rule that could say which
 *   bodies are sensitive. An OAuth refresh-token grant is
 *   `grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=…` in a POST body, so the whole
 *   long-lived credential arrives intact at whatever the `Location` named.
 *
 * The body case is strictly worse than the header case and is the one that
 * decided the design below.
 *
 * ## What this does, and the alternative that was rejected
 *
 * `redirect: "manual"`, then follow the `Location` here — but **only when it is
 * same-origin**, at most a few hops. A cross-origin `Location` is refused with
 * a `CrossOriginRedirectError` rather than followed.
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to follow anywhere and strip credentials on the
 * cross-origin hop. It was rejected on three counts, in increasing order of how
 * decisive they are:
 *
 * 1. *The strip list cannot be written.* Stripping means enumerating which
 *    headers are secret, and the whole point of a provider descriptor is that
 *    the auth header is provider-defined. Any list is a list of the headers
 *    someone remembered.
 * 2. *It does not address the body at all.* Dropping the body on a 307 turns a
 *    token grant into a malformed request that the target answers with an
 *    error; keeping it hands over the refresh token. There is no third option,
 *    so "strip credentials" is not actually expressible for the case that
 *    matters most.
 * 3. *It succeeds quietly.* Having stripped, the request goes out anyway — now
 *    unauthenticated, to an attacker-chosen origin, and the caller sees a
 *    plain 401 from somewhere it never meant to talk to. Refusing produces an
 *    error that names both origins, which is the only outcome an operator can
 *    act on.
 *
 * Following *same-origin* redirects rather than refusing all of them is the
 * deliberate concession: `https://api.example.com/v1` → `…/v1/` and
 * `http://host` → `https://host` are ordinary provider behaviour, no credential
 * leaves the origin it was minted for, and refusing them would mean every
 * caller re-implementing the follow.
 *
 * `tools.ts` stays on bare `redirect: "manual"` and does not use this, and that
 * is not an oversight: it hands the 3xx back to the agent on purpose, so the
 * agent must re-issue and pay for a second allow-list check. Here there is no
 * agent to hand anything to.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from Andromeda `src/utils/redirects.ts`.

 * replaces in the one respect callers can observe. 307 and 308 exist precisely
 * to preserve the method and body, and since the hop is same-origin there is
 * nothing unsafe about honouring them.
 *
 * A body that cannot be replayed is refused rather than silently sent empty. In
 * practice every engine call site passes a string, so this is a guard against a
